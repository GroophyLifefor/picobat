Dos9 uses autotools as build system, so building it is quite straightforward.
First we don't recommand you to install dos9 in the system directory as it is
still a little bit unstable.
I recommand some folder in your home directory (such as ~/dos9) to install it.
To build it and install it, just type the following line :

./configure --prefix=your_folder --bindir=your_folder --libdir=your_folder
make
make install dos9-install-clean
