QUICK STARTING INFORMATION

     This is a litte document that describes first steps with the Dos9 command 
     prompt. This is an EXPERIMENTAL WORK (as it is a beta) so it might be 
     possible that some aspect described here, or in the documentation might 
     be buggy, or would'nt simply work.

     If you encounter such bugs or issues, feel free to send an email to 
     <darkbatcher@dos9.org> with a description of the bug, or even a fix if 
     you want to contribute.

BUILDING DOS9

     To get DOS9 binaries, you have two options :

        - Download precompiled binaries package from DOS9's sourceforge page. 
          Then you just have to unpack the package on your computer. This 
          method is only availiable for WINDOWS. Indeed, for *NIX systems, 
          it's about going mad to make distribution-portable binaries, for 
          *NIX users, the second solution must be used.

        - Download sources and then build them yourself. To eases this work, 
          just download sources package from DOS9's sourceforge page, or just 
          get them from the git repository using :

             git clone ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/dos9/code dos9-code

          When you have downloaded sources, you just need to compile them 
          using any C compiler. For WINDOWS system, it is more complicated 
          than getting precompiled binaries because you need to have gcc and 
          gmake installed on your system. On WINDOWS, you should also have a 
          *NIX compatible shell. If not, you can get one from the MINGW 
          project. For *NIX system, doing so is as simple as typing :

             make *nix

          WINDOWS users just have to specify ``win'' target instead ``*nix''. 
          Windows users also need to move non native dependencies *.dll from 
          the folder ``depend'' to the folder ``bin''.

     A list of needed programs and tools to be able to build DOS9 properly can 
     be obtained by typing:

        make

FIRST STEPS

     Once you have binaries, you can run DOS9 since it has no need to be 
     installed in order to work. If you want to associate it with .BAT or 
     .CMD files though, do not associate it with both file types, as DOS9 is 
     still an unstable software.

     Once you launched DOS9, you can type batch commands lines. Remember that 
     if you need some help, the help program is HLP. Note that if you can not 
     browse the documentation due to the lack of translation or else, you can 
     still read the different translations of the documentation in several 
     languages and formats in the subfolder ``share/doc''.

     If the executable crash, please send a mail to : <darkbatcher@dos9.org>.

CHANGING THE LANGUAGE

     If the language of the interpretor or of the documentation is in your 
     langage under MS-WINDOWS, then you should configure the ``Dos9_Auto.bat'' 
     script that DOS9 launches at startup. Normally this is not necessary as 
     GNU GETTEXT automatically chose your langage. Modify the following line :

         :: SET LANGUAGE=en_US

     Uncomment the line and replace EN_US by the name of your locale. It is 
     still possible that the langage does not work though, this means that 
     DOS9 is not translated yet in your language. Note that dos9 might be 
     translated into your language, and manual page can be not translated, so 
     if you use HLP, it might crash. Nevertheless, this should'nt occur as 
     HLP failsback to english.

MAKING TRANSLATION

     Translations uses the GNU GETTEXT tool. To make translation, run the 
     ``dos9-build-gettext.bat'' script to produce .PO files (avaliable from 
     the sources) for your language, and then, translate it via a po editor 
     like POEDIT or KBABEL.

     To submit translation, send it to : <darkbatcher@dos9.org>
