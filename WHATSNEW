        - Dos9 has now 3 native variables :

             - %DOS9_VERSION% : The version of the running Dos9.

             - %DOS9_PATH% : The path of Dos9 interpreter.

MONDAY 11TH, MARCH

        - Solve many portability issues (i.e some programs did not work under 
          Linux).

        - Reprogrammed whole Man utility, which has been named "dman" to avoid 
          confusion on POSIX-compatible Systems.

             - DMan is able to run on several platforms natively.

             - DMan is more simple to use, since it makes it possible to use 
               links man pages.

        - Fixed some bugs on BatMan.

        - BatMan is now mainly portable.

        - Fixed a bug in delayed variable expansion.

        - Corected support of delayed expansion that didn't match to the way 
          cmd.exe parses it.

        - Added support of expression evaluating (might migrate to GNU 
          LibMathEval soon).

        - Added new kind of page support for dMan, it uses now a 
          zip-compressed file that contains several pages and saves up disk.

        - Added a console-side text editor (an alternative to BatMan), GNU 
          Nano.

        - Modified nano to highlight batch code.

        - Fixed a bug in a parameter for delayed expansion 
          (cEnableDelayedExpansion was not taken account).

             - Dos9 Project DUMP : A hex-dumper.

        - Added i18n support (through GNU gettext).

        - Added a README file.

TUESDAY 17TH, SEPTEMBER

        - Fixed bug with the message ``Error : "..." is not recognized as 
          ...'' message in linux version.

        - Fixed bug with the wait() function in that made the program hold 
          indefinetly.

THURSDAY 16TH, OCTOBER

        - Changed build architecture. Now, the package can be built through a 
          single commmand line, that build all dependencies, i.e.:

             Make -B

        - Added a lock specifier to the structure STREAMLVL that enables to 
          fix bugs with nested redirection levels. Like those that occured 
          running the following script:

             IF 1==1 (
              ECHO This goes to file2 
              ECHO This goes to file1 > file 1
              ECHO This goes to file2, again
             ) > file 2

        - Added a kind of old allocated ESTR structure reuser, that avoid 
          reallocating new estr structures. (Saves up speed).

SUNDAY 27TH, OCTOBER

        - Some bug fixes, including a bug that appeared with ``%~A''.

        - Added primary support of FOR loops (ie. simple for loop without 
          options).

FRIDAY 13TH, DECEMBER

        - Solved some bugs in libDos9 (a hazardous non initialized var)

        - Added support FOR /F loops with files as input.

THURSDAY 2ND, JUNUARY 2014

        - Corrected DOS9_SCRIPTCOMMAND.C bugs in which the delayed expansion 
          was not executed even if it was enabled.

        - Corrected some manual page

        - added some translated pages

        - added new MAKE system.

        - added expressions (both INTERGER and FLOAT mode) for the SET /A 
          command.

        - added FOR /F loop support with string as input.

        - added support for top-level blocks.

THURSDAY 14TH, JUNUARY

        - added final support of FOR /F including the use of command outputs 
          as FOR input.

        - added DOS9_SEARCH_NO_CURRENT_DIR which does not include the pseudo 
          directories '..' and '.'.

        - corrected a compatibility bug with CMD.EXE: DIR /B returned the 
          pseudo directories '..' and '.'.

        - corrected an expansion bug with %%~A (and similar var because the 
          interpretor missinterpreted the command if, for example %%~AX was 
          badly expanded if %%X was not defined). Now, the choosed varaible is 
          the largest match defined.

        - corrected bug with simple FOR processing.

        - added partial support of FOR /R. (Note: this is provided for 
          compatibility purpose, and that new scripts should not use theses 
          switches anymore.)

        - added version information as a header file, making version 
          management easier.

        - added a function to be executed automatically on exit.

        - some minor bugfixes.

        - some manual pages enhancement.

WEDNESDAY 15TH, JUNUARY

        - fixed a bug that prevented both FOR /R and FOR /D to be executed the 
          right way.

        - fixed a bug with use of . in file searches.

FRIDAY 17TH, JUNUARY

        - Fixed a bug that caused some particular redirections to be 
          misinterpreted, particularly, in blocks ``(echo test>NUL)'' trigered 
          an error, because the output was interpreted to be a redirection to 
          file ``NUL)''. This has been solved, and both '(' , '|' and '&' 
          operators are no prioritary.

        - Modified version information management. Now version are numbered in 
          the folowing way: YYYY.MAJOR.MINOR[TAG]. Where :

             - YYYY : Is the year the version was released.

             - MAJOR : The major version of DOS9.

             - MINOR : The minor version of DOS9.

             - TAG : An optionnal character, meaning :

                  - D : Develloper version.

                  - B : Beta version.

        - Fixed problem with broken make.

        - Enhanced features of FILELIST* functions of libDos9. Search is now 
          quicker. It also resulted in better execution times of the FOR /R 
          function (even though still deprecated).

MONDAY 20TH, JUNUARY

        - Corrected a but that cause line like ``:: comment & command'' to 
          execute the command COMMAND, unlike CMD.EXE's behaviour.

        - Added REM command and comments manual page.

        - Fixed broken make that did not build DUMP command.

        - Added endianness support to DUMP command.

        - Behaviour of DOS9 is now the same as CMD.EXE's one towards block.

        - Fixed a bug that required both @ and : signs to be at first column.

        - Fixed a bug that prevented redirection to be executed in a top-level 
          block.

        - Added copyright notice to all manual pages.

        - Fixed a bug with an added extra space with redirection placed at end 
          of input line.

THURSDAY 23TH, JUNUARY

        - Fixed a bug with the TITLE command. The TITLE command set a title 
          that was the whole command line (including TITLE statement).

        - Fixed a bug with the FILELIST features. It now works as expected 
          with both '/' (filesystem root sign) and '[driveletter]:/' with 
          windows.

FRIDAY 24TH, JUNUARY

        - Started working on an enhanced version of TEA text preprocessor.

SATURDAY 1ST, FEBRUARY

        - Final version of TEAV2. Added support for both HTML 5, HTML 4.01 and 
          XHTML. Others formats have been dropped.

        - Fixed a bug with the parsing of command line parameter. If, the 
          final parameter was enclosed in quotes (simple or double), it 
          resulted in undefined behaviour.

        - Fixed a bug that prevented user from include pipes in FOR /F command 
          input.

        - Enhanced pipe features.

        - Fixed a bug that caused the following message

             Error : Unable to release mutex

          to be printed at exit, due to an undefined behavior with ATEXIT() 
          function.
