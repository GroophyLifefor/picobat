MONDAY 11TH, MARCH

        - Solve many portability issues (i.e some programs did not work under 
          Linux)

        - Reprogrammed whole Man utility, which has been named "dman" to avoid 
          confusion on POSIX-compatible Systems.

             - DMan is able to run on several platforms natively.

             - DMan is more simple to use, since it makes it possible to use 
               links man pages.

THURSDAY 11TH, APRIL

        - Corected support of delayed expansion that didn't match to the way 
          cmd.exe parses it

        - Added support of expression evaluating (might migrate to GNU 
          LibMathEval soon)

        - Added new kind of page support for dMan, it uses now a zip-compressed
          file that contains several pages and saves up disk

        - Added a console-side text editor (an alternative to BatMan), GNU 
          Nano.

        - Modified nano to highlight batch code.

        Make -B

        - Added a lock specifier to the structure STREAMLVL that enables to fix
          bugs with nested redirection levels. Like those that occured running 
          the following script:

        IF 1==1 (
         ECHO This goes to file2 
         ECHO This goes to file1 > file 1
         ECHO This goes to file2, again
        ) > file 2
