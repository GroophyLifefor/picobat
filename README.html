<h1>The Dos9 Project</h1>



<p>This is a litte document that describes first steps with the Dos9 command 

prompt. This is an <strong>experimental work</strong> (as it is a beta) so it might be possible 

that some aspect described here, or in the documentation might be buggy, or 

would'nt simply work.</p>



<p>If you encounter such bugs or issues, feel free to send an email to 

&lt;darkbatcher@dos9.org&gt; with a description of the bug, or even a fix if you

want to contribute.</p>

<h2>Building dos9</h2>



<p>To get <strong>Dos9</strong> binaries, you have two options :</p>



<p>* Download precompiled binaries package from <strong>Dos9</strong>'s sourceforge page. Then you 

just have to unpack the package on your computer. This method is only availiable

for <strong>windows</strong>. Indeed, for <strong>*nix</strong> systems, it about going mad to make 

distribution-portable binaries, for <strong>*nix</strong> users, the second solution must be 

used.</p>



<p>* Download sources and then build them yourself. To eases this work, just 

download sources package from <strong>Dos9</strong>'s sourceforge page, or just get them from 

the git repository using :</p>



<code>git clone ssh://darkbatcher@git.code.sf.net/p/dos9/code dos9-code</code>



<p>When you have downloaded sources, you just need to compile them using any C 

compiler. For <strong>windows</strong> system, it is more complicated than getting precompiled 

binaries because you need to have gcc and gmake installed on your system. For <strong>

*nix</strong> system, doing so is as simple as typing :</p>



<code>export TARGET_OS=linux 

make -B</code>



<p><strong>Windows</strong> users just have to remove the first line, obviously. Windows users also

need to move non native dependencies *.dll from the folder ``depend'' to the 

folder ``bin''. </p>



<h2>First steps</h2>



<p>Once you have binaries, you can run <strong>Dos9</strong> since it has no need to be installed 

in order to work. If you want to associate it with <strong>.bat</strong> or <strong>.cmd</strong> files though, 

do not associate it with both file types, as <strong>Dos9</strong> is still an unstable 

software.</p>



<p>Once you launched <strong>Dos9</strong>, you can type batch commands lines. Remember that if you

need some help, the help program is <strong>HLP</strong>. Note that if you can not browse the 

documentation due to the lack of translation or else, you can still read the 

different translations of the documentation in several languages and formats in 

the subfolder ``share/doc''.</p>



<p>If the executable crash, please send a mail to : &lt;darkbatcher@dos9.org&gt;.</p>



<h2>Changing the language</h2>



<p>If the language of the interpretor or of the documentation might not be in your 

langage under <strong>MS-WINDOWS</strong>, thus you should configure the ``Dos9_Auto.bat'' 

script that <strong>Dos9</strong> launches at startup. Modify the following line :</p>



<code> SET LANGUAGE=en_US</code>



<p>Replace <strong>en_US</strong> by the name of your local. It is still possible that the langage 

does not work though, this means that <strong>Dos9</strong> is not translated yet in your 

language. Note that dos9 might be translated into your language, and manual page

can be not translated, so if you use <strong>HLP</strong>, it might crash. Nevertheless, this 

should'nt occur as <strong>HLP</strong> failsback to english. </p>



<h2>Making translation</h2>



<p>Translations uses the <strong>GNU gettext</strong> tool. To make translation, run the 

``dos9-build-gettext.bat'' script to produce <strong>.po</strong> files for your language, and 

then, translate it via a po editor like <strong>poedit</strong> or <strong>kbabel</strong>.</p>



<p>To submit translation, send it to : &lt;darkbatcher@dos9.org&gt;</p>
