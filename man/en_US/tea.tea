{{TEA Command}}

	The {TEA} (Tea Expands Ascii) command is a text preprocessor allowing
	easy and fast formating for documents (either text or html).
	
	The {TEA} markup language is lightweight and designed to be simple to learn
	and to understand, allowing the preprocessor to have the tiniest size as
	possible.

{{Synopsis}}

${TEA source [output] [/E[:]encoding] [/O[:]mode]}

	Creates a text or HTML document from the {source}.

	- {source} : The source file that {TEA} will preprocess (this file should
	be using {tea_syntax|TEA syntax})
	
	- {output} : The file that {TEA} will generate. You have to 
	specify the correct extension
	for the file as {TEA} does not use this to determine the type of the output.

	- {/E[:]encoding} : Specify the encoding that should be used to process the text.
	The encoding can be :

		-- {UTF-8} : Use utf-8. If you choose this encoding, then any BOM will be
		ignored from {source}.

		-- Any other encoding will be treated as a single-byte encoding.

	- {/O[:]mode} : Chooses an output format

		-- {TEXT} : Produce a text file without coloration. Characters 
		are used to denote the formating and
		target of links are integrated in the file. This is the defautlt
		Output

		-- {TEXT-PLAIN} : Produce a text file that is more easy to read
		but with less formating

		-- {TEXT-ANSI} : Produces a text file formated using ANSI escape
		code so that it is readable on any compatible terminal.
		
		-- {HTML} : Produces a HTML document.


{{Synopsis - HTML Options}}

	You can specify some more option for HTML generation, which are the
	following :
	
${TEA source output /O:HTML [/M meta] [/H head] [/F foot] [/T title] [/C[:]mode]}

	Where :

		- {/M meta} : A file to include within the <head> tag of {output}.

		- {/H head} : A file to include just after the <body> tag of {output}.
		
		- {/F foot} :  A file to include just before the </body> tag of {output}.

		- {/T title} : Specifies a prefix that should be added to the title.

		- {/C[:]mode} : Chooses some compatibility mode (default output is HTML5)

			-- {HTML4} : Generate a valid HTML4.1 file

			-- {XHTML} : Generate a valid XHTML file
			
			-- {MD} : Generate a valid markdown file for {pbat.org}

	The tea syntax is described in {tea_syntax|TEA Syntax} page.
