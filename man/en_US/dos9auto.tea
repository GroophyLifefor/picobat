{{Dos9 Initialization (Dos9_Auto.bat)}}

	{dos9|Dos9} is initialized through the execution of a batch script
	named {Dos9_Auto.bat}. This file sets some variables and calls
	user defined scripts.

{{Synopsis}}

${%DOS9_PATH%/Dos9_Auto.bat}

	This file is not meant to be edited directly, since it calls
	user defined scripts. It can be nonetheless useful to modify it
	to fit some special requirements. If you modify it, be careful
	not to do anything wrong with it as it can eventually affect the
	behaviour of some scripts.
	
	Usually, the file {Dos9_Auto.bat} sets {dos9var|Dos9 global variables}
	that are not dynamic.
	
	Finally {Dos9_Auto.bat} also call two user defined scripts :
	
	- {%USERPROFILE%/.dos9/Dos9_Auto.bat} : User startup file
	
	- {%DOS9_ETC%/Dos9_Auto.bat} : System wide startup file.

	In both of these script, any {commands|Dos9 command} can be used
	safely.
	
	Note that since the first multi-threaded release {218.1}, the 
	execution of {Dos9_Auto.bat} has changed a lot. The script gets
	executed upon either:
	
	- {Dos9} start-up, that is when a new interpreter is launched
	without parents.
	
	- or {Dos9} is {explicitly} called from a script or from the 
	prompt. This means {Dos9_Auto.bat} does not get executed any more
	upon {spec/condop|pipe} call or {for|FOR} command. 
	
{{Compatibility}}

	Not compatible with {cmd.exe}, the initialization mechanisms differ.

	Available since {0.7}.
