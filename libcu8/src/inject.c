       pointer stored in tbl_fn.

       Note there is another constraint, the sequence will be inserted within
       msvcrt function, so it needs to be really short, otherwise it won't
       fit and subsequent replacement may overwrite parts of it.

       These codes have the advantage to be simple and not to affect most of the
       calling conventions on windows, such as __cdecl, __stdcall, __fastcall
       or so.

        The code[] array contains opcode for the following assembler mnemonics

                x86_64 mode            |               i386 mode

            jmp [rel32]                |          jmp addr32


        This mnemonics are fairly interesting because they result in *exactly*
        the same binary code, simplifying the code greatly
