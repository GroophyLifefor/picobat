"DOS9 COMMAND\n"
"\n"
"        DOS9 is a free, cross-platform command prompt used for batch "
"scripts \n"
"     and command processing.\n"
"\n"
"        DOS9 is a free software, designed to be as compatible as possible "

"     CMD.EXE proprietary software from MICROSOFT.\n"

"SYNOPSIS\n"
"\n"
"   DOS9 [/v] [/n] [/f] [/e] [file]\n"
"\n"
"        Run a command file or wait for an user input.\n"
"\n"
"        - FILE : Path of the batch script to be run.\n"
"\n"
"        - /V : Enables delayed expansion (see `spec/xvar').\n"
"\n"
"        - /N : Enables dos9's extension (see `spec/ext').\n"
"\n"
"        - /F : Enables floating numbers (see `spec/exp').\n"

"COMPATIBILITY\n"
"\n"
"        Compatible with any version of DOS9. Incompatible with CMD.EXE.\n"
"\n"
"        Dos9 is cross-platform so that it can be run either on MS-WINDOWS "
