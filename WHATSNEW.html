<ul><li>
<p> Changed build architecture. Now, the package can be built through a single commmand line, that build all dependencies, i.e.:</p>

<code>Make -B</code>

</li><li><p> Added a lock specifier to the structure STREAMLVL that enables to fix bugs with nested redirection levels. Like those that occured running the following script:</p>

<code>IF 1==1 (<br /> ECHO This goes to file2 <br /> ECHO This goes to file1 &gt; file 1<br /> ECHO This goes to file2, again<br />) &gt; file 2</code>

</li></ul>
<h2>Sunday 27th, October</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Some bug fixes, including a bug that appeared with ``%~A''.</p>

</li><li><p> Added primary support of <strong>FOR</strong> loops (ie. simple for loop without options).</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 13th, December</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Solved some bugs in libDos9 (a hazardous non initialized var)</p>

</li><li><p> Added support <strong>FOR /F</strong> loops with files as input.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 2nd, Junuary 2014</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Corrected <strong>Dos9_ScriptCommand.c</strong> bugs in which the delayed expansion was not executed even if it was enabled.</p>

</li><li><p> Corrected some manual page</p>

</li><li><p> added some translated pages</p>

</li><li><p> added new <strong>make</strong> system.</p>

</li><li><p> added <strong>FOR /F</strong> loop support with string as input.</p>

</li><li><p> added support for top-level blocks.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 14th, Junuary</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> added final support of <strong>FOR /F</strong> including the use of command outputs as <strong>FOR</strong> input.</p>

</li><li><p> added <strong>DOS9_SEARCH_NO_CURRENT_DIR</strong> which does not include the pseudo directories '..' and '.'.</p>

</li><li><p> corrected a compatibility bug with <strong>cmd.exe</strong>: <strong>DIR /b</strong> returned the pseudo directories '..' and '.'.</p>

</li><li><p> corrected an expansion bug with <strong>%%~a</strong> (and similar var because the interpretor missinterpreted the command if, for example <strong>%%~ax</strong> was badly expanded if <strong>%%x</strong> was not defined). Now, the choosed varaible is the largest match defined.</p>

</li><li><p> corrected bug with simple <strong>FOR</strong> processing.</p>

</li><li><p> added partial support of <strong>FOR /R</strong>. (Note: this is provided for compatibility purpose, and that new scripts should not use theses switches anymore.)</p>

</li><li><p> added version information as a header file, making version management easier.</p>

</li><li><p> added a function to be executed automatically on exit.</p>

<h2>Wednesday 15th, Junuary</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> fixed a bug that prevented both <strong>FOR /R</strong> and <strong>FOR /D</strong> to be executed the right way.</p>

</li><li><p> fixed a bug with use of <strong>.</strong> in file searches.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 17th, Junuary</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Fixed a bug that caused some particular redirections to be misinterpreted, particularly, in blocks ``(echo test&gt;NUL)'' trigered an error, because the output was interpreted to be a redirection to file ``NUL)''. This has been solved, and both '(' , '|' and '&' operators are no prioritary.</p>

</li><li><p> Modified version information management. Now version are numbered in the folowing way: <strong>YYYY.major.minor[tag]</strong>. Where :</p>

<ul><li>
<p> <strong>YYYY</strong> : Is the year the version was released.</p>

</li><li><p> <strong>major</strong> : The major version of <strong>Dos9</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> <strong>minor</strong> : The minor version of <strong>Dos9</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> <strong>tag</strong> : An optionnal character, meaning :</p>

<ul><li>
<p> <strong>d</strong> : Develloper version.</p>

</li><li><p> <strong>b</strong> : Beta version.</p>

</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li><p> Fixed problem with broken make.</p>

</li><li><p> Enhanced features of <strong>FILELIST*</strong> functions of libDos9. Search is now quicker. It also resulted in better execution times of the <strong>FOR /R</strong> function (even though still deprecated).</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Monday 20th, Junuary</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Corrected a but that cause line like ``:: comment & command'' to execute the command <strong>command</strong>, unlike <strong>cmd.exe</strong>'s behaviour.</p>

</li><li><p> Added <strong>REM</strong> command and comments manual page.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed broken make that did not build <strong>DUMP</strong> command.</p>

</li><li><p> Added endianness support to <strong>DUMP</strong> command.</p>

</li><li><p> Behaviour of <strong>Dos9</strong> is now the same as <strong>cmd.exe</strong>'s one towards block.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that required both <strong>@</strong> and <strong>:</strong> signs to be at first column.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that prevented redirection to be executed in a top-level block.</p>

</li><li><p> Added copyright notice to all manual pages.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with an added extra space with redirection placed at end of input line.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 23th, Junuary</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Fixed a bug with the <strong>TITLE</strong> command. The <strong>TITLE</strong> command set a title that was the whole command line (including <strong>TITLE</strong> statement).</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with the <strong>FILELIST</strong> features. It now works as expected with both '/' (filesystem root sign) and '[driveletter]:/' with windows.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 24th, Junuary</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Started working on an enhanced version of <strong>TEA</strong> text preprocessor.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Saturday 1st, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Final version of <strong>TEAv2</strong>. Added support for both <strong>HTML 5</strong>, <strong>HTML 4.01</strong> and <strong>xHTML</strong>. Others formats have been dropped.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with the parsing of command line parameter. If, the final parameter was enclosed in quotes (simple or double), it resulted in undefined behaviour.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that prevented user from include pipes in <strong>FOR /F</strong> command input.</p>

</li><li><p> Enhanced pipe features.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that caused the following message</p>

<code>Error : Unable to release mutex</code>

<p>to be printed at exit, due to an undefined behavior with <strong>atexit()</strong> function.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 7th, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Fixed a bug of <strong>SET /P</strong> subcommand. The bug caused a SEGFAULT to be raised on execution.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a major bug that prevented command search to be executed normally, it returned the shortest match available instead of the largest available one.</p>

</li><li><p> Added an error message if the <strong>SET</strong> command is unable to set environment variable.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 12th, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Fixed a bug of <strong>SET /P</strong> subcommand, that didn't not removed the carriage return at the end of the input.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 13th, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Found a bug that occurs when using <strong>CD</strong> command from inside a batch script, if the path to the script given is relative, <strong>Dos9</strong> tries to open it in the new current path, and fail, or execute a different script depending on circumstances. This is to be fixed in next release (that will include a bunch of improvements, like <strong>CALL</strong>, I hope).</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 14th, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Started working in version <strong>2014.0.8</strong>, a version that will include more features, (including use of intelligent help browsing, and improved command searching (through a own procedure, instead of what was used previously).</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with multiple lists in <strong>TEA</strong> html mode.</p>

</li><li><p> Added own function to search files in path. It is not used everywhere though.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 21th, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Added support of new threaded function, through a particular header.</p>

</li><li><p> The issue of uncontrolled sub-threads that continued to be executed was a major concerns, this is fixed thanks to the new thread functions.</p>

</li><li><p> Solved some errors that occured when forcing binary input. A few too hopefull assumption were corected, so that the interpretor will not fail if a binary file (e.g. randomly generated bytes, such as executables) is given as batch script, it will just printf a few (or more) errors messages at the prompt.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Monday 24th, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Solve a bug that prevented correct <strong>%ERROLEVEL%</strong> values from being correctly used, it used to be ignored when using internal commands.</p>

</li><li><p> Decided of a change in the way to deal with variables, in order to enable more compatibility between <strong>Dos9</strong> and <strong>CMD.exe</strong>. The changes resides in the way var and special vars are parsed.</p>

<p>On the one hand, to make the difference between the two kind of variables, I decided the only way to denote a special var (ie. like <strong>%%A</strong>) is to prefix it with two percent. Except for variables like <strong>%0, %1</strong> and so on, which can be accessed with a single <strong>%</strong> for compatibility purposes. This new conventions provides more stylished script and prevent ``name crashes'', (ie. unexpected behaviour caused for exemple by the following code) :</p>

<code>ECHO %1 test%<br />:: since spaces in variables names are valid, the result can <br />:: be unexpected depending whether ``%1'' or ``%1 test%'' are<br />:: expanded first.<br /></code>

<p>On the other, the only way to specify environment variables is the conventionnal way, with single ``%''. Note that this behaviour has also changed, undefined variables will be replaced by a void string (they'll be just stripped from the output).</p>

<p>Finally, in some cases, using ``%a'' to specify the special variable will work either, but well, it can just happen on a very few cases, so that it is preferable not to use this notation.</p>

</li><li><p> Changed <strong>Dos9</strong> behaviour towards <strong>%0, ..., %9</strong> variables. Those which are not explicitelly specified at startup will be filled with an empty string, and will expand to the empty string.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thessday 25th, February</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Finalized behaviour change for variables. Singles <strong>%</strong> are now splited from the input at parsing, exception made for the special variables <strong>%0, ..., %9</strong> for which the use of a single percent is still valid (for compatibility purposes) as stated previously. This prevent users from using single '%' to denote a special var other than these specified previously.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that made <strong>SET /P</strong> subfunction to return inconsistent <strong>%ERRORLEVEL%</strong> codes. In fact, it was the reverse of normal behaviour, that is :</p>

<ul><li>
<p> Returning <strong>-1</strong> on error.</p>

</li><li><p> Returning <strong>0</strong> on success.</p>

</li></ul>
</li><li><p> Added an example of batch powered by Dos9, a multifunction caculator using both floating point arithmetics and integer arithmetics.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 6th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Changed the behaviour of the function which decide wether the command is multiline or not. It now correctly handles parenthesis that are not multiline. For example, the following code used to be expected to continue on next lines :</p>

<code>echo(some test&if 1 equ 1 echo some other test</code>

<p>However, this behaviour is not actually resolved, indeed, some error might occurs (in some very special case) if the previous is run. This is still to be fixed.</p>

</li><li><p> Added more compatible version of <strong>ECHO</strong> command. The command now tolerates various non-mainstream syntax (ie. using other characters than '.' to force print). The following variants are accepted :</p>

<code>echo!<br />echo"<br />echo#<br />echo$<br />echo%<br />echo&<br />echo'<br />echo(<br />echo)<br />echo*<br />echo+<br />echo,<br />echo-<br />echo.<br />echo/<br />echo[<br />echo\<br />echo]<br />echo^<br />echo_<br />echo`</code>

<p>Most of these syntax are however not recommended, because they can cause obvious syntax errors, and are only provided for compatibility purposes.</p>

<p>The characters that were given are those specified by the <strong>ISO-C 90</strong> standard, so that some locale may provide additionnal characters.</p>

</li><li><p> Switched to <strong>Autoconf</strong> build system. This allows more standard builds, with <strong>GNU</strong> build toolchain. I can be compiled through a <strong>*NIX</strong>-shell typing:</p>

<code>./configure<br />make</code>

<p>The install target is not supported yet. It also does not use <strong>Automake</strong>, since it is hard to see the point of writing awfull Makefile.am in order to produce a Makefile that can be written by hand.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Friday 7th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Started to work on a safer block determination. This should not be to difficult to obtain.</p>

</li><li><p> Started to refresh a large part of the core, which i includes rewritting what were called modules, and are now just outdated piece of code. I hope those changes to be functionnal within a short delay. It is mainly about getting rid of old and ugly pieces of codes i've been writting about two years ago. Some function have also been transfered to libDos9, this is limited however, since Dos9 is not stable enough to get it in a whole library.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Saturday 8th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Added brand new parser, and also, brand new file reader. The new implementations are much more safe and elegant. Lots of repetitions in the code have be gathered into singles funciton to make it more maintainable.</p>

</li><li><p> Silenced `Dos9_Jump.c', but hoping to get it works within a short time.</p>

</li><li><p> Added new string search based that take account of escaped-characters (ie. Characters preceded by '^').</p>

</li><li><p> Lots of bugfixes, particularly with the new parser and reader.</p>

</li><li><p> <strong>Dos9</strong> is much more unstable than it was, but it is to be fixed quickly since new version are easier to maintain.</p>

</li><li><p> Changed behaviour of function than are used to get command-line arguments. It already did line delayed expansion, but is include now unescaping (ie. removing '^'). Thus some syntax have became valid, such as :</p>

<code>echo ^!test^!</code>

<p>This will output <strong>!test!</strong>, without expanding the variable, even if <strong>test</strong> is defined.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that, syntax with escaping and with quotes are <strong>strictly</strong> equivalent. As an example, take the following code :</p>

<code>if foo^ bar equ "foo bar" echo YES</code>

<p>Using, <strong>Dos9</strong>, the code will output <strong>YES</strong>. However, <strong>cmd.exe</strong> will not. It as been chosen to promote the first syntax since it is more easy to handle and far less tricky than escaping characters with <strong>cmd.exe</strong>, which require an almost random number of '^' to escape some character. </p>

</li><li><p> Optimised <strong>Dos9_RunBlock()</strong> function.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 12th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Changed behavior of the thread functions of libDos9. The <strong>THREAD</strong> structure now refers to the thread ID rather than to a handle to that thread. This new behaviour make it possible to work with thread without left a handle on this thread opened. It also enables the stack to contain <strong>THREAD</strong> structures on both <strong>*nix</strong> and <strong>windows</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> Added timeout to the Dos9_WaitForAllThreads function. This is usefull in case of deadlocks or in case of thread that does not terminate.</p>

</li><li><p> Added Dos9_AbortAllThread function, that kills all remaining thread (only those that were lauched through Dos9_BeginThread)</p>

</li><li><p> Added Dos9_AbortThread function, that kills a thread.</p>

</li><li><p> fixed a bug in the thread library that sometimes causes Dos9 to wait undefinetely, because function Dos9_WaitForAllThread and Dos9_EndThread sometimes deadlocked, in a random basis.</p>

</li><li><p> Re-enable <strong>GOTO</strong> function, that works now (even with cross file argument).</p>

</li><li><p> Added <strong>TEXT-ANSI</strong> target to the <strong>tea</strong> text processor. It enables creation of colorized output using ansi escapes code. the use of this is native in <strong>*nix</strong> and requires ansicon in <strong>windows</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that caused infinite loop if the file read was no more accessible. It now returns and just prints error message.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug causing <strong>eof</strong> not to be detected in some circumstances.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that caused an error to be printed in the case that a script that was loaded with the <strong>GOTO</strong> command contained a <strong>CD</strong> command so that the file could not be retrieved because it was kept with a relative path.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 13th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Fixed bugs with the run functions. The use of <strong>program || goto error</strong> to perform feature test is avaliable for both windows and *nix.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed bugs with <strong>Dos9_SplitPath</strong> command in *nix.</p>

</li><li><p> Added a search in <strong>%PATH%</strong> and <strong>%PATHEXT%</strong> (only in windows) before running any command.</p>

</li><li><p> Added a redirection for command that have <strong>.cmd</strong> or <strong>.bat</strong> as extension. Those files are now executed by a subprocess of <strong>Dos9</strong> instead of being loaded by <strong>cmd.exe</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed bug with <strong>Dos9_GetFilePath</strong> function. It prevented executables that were in one of the <strong>%PATH%</strong> directory to be found if a folder with the same name was in the same directory.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed bug with the <strong>Dos9_FileExists</strong> function from libDos9. It sometimes returned true for files that where in the path though not in the current directory.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with several encapsed blocks. The previous parser did not searched for block after a block was solved (this is is now corrected)</p>

</li><li><p> Improved block support by providing more routines and by making the code more efficient.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug in <strong>Dos9_ExpandVar</strong> function that was introduced build ago when rules for expansion changed. I'm affraid not to have seen it before.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with <strong>Dos9_EsCpyN</strong> function in libDos9. If the functions with 0 as iSize argument, although the function is expected to produce a void string, it failed in windows, thanks to microsoft's crt implementation, that throws a SIGSEGV if the last parameter of <strong>strncpy</strong> is 0.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with <strong>FOR</strong> command. The tokenizer did not behave like it is describded in the documenntation : If several delimiters were encountered in a raw, they were not skipped.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with the <strong>ECHO</strong> command. The prompt line (ie. <strong>DOS9 ...&gt;</strong>) was displayed whenever the <strong>ECHO off</strong> flag was set, on direct input mode.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that caused some commands to print error messages on <strong>FOR</strong> commands. Most notably, the <strong>FIND</strong> command (or at least, windows's implementation) fails if there is no space at end of line, so it added automatically now.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with <strong>SET /A</strong> subcommand. It prefixed variable name with a space, making the result inconsistent.</p>

</li><li><p> Made the hlp to work again, without problem, since version <strong>0.7</strong> and the deep changes made into <strong>Dos9</strong> core to get something more modern.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Sunday 16th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Started building a <strong>x64</strong> version of Dos9. I experienced troubles because of the lack of <strong>x64</strong> version of <strong>MinGW</strong>. However, I managed to get a distribution of mingw-w64, the <strong>MinGW</strong> compiler adapted for <strong>x64</strong>, in the TDM-gcc. The install of <strong>libintl</strong> (and libiconv, on which libintl depends) must be done by downloading packages from GNU ports, and do some tricks to get it compiled in the x64 version. This is actually difficult to build, and unstable as a did not perform further tests.</p>

</li><li><p> Started profiling the <strong>Dos9</strong> codebase, looking for making <strong>Dos9</strong> more fast. The use of <strong>gprof</strong> has brought several interesting analysis. On the one hand, I can't get explaination why is <strong>cmd.exe</strong> faster for long files, although if both are run at the same time, <strong>Dos9</strong> perform about twice as much commands by second. The things to be updated are:</p>

<ul><li>
<p> <strong>Dos9_EsInit</strong> and <strong>Dos9_EsFree</strong> function are far too expensive. It sometimes consumes <strong>10%</strong> of the global time-run, thus, we removed parts of code from the <strong>libDos9</strong> library.</p>

</li><li><p> <strong>Dos9_GetCommandProc</strong> is far too expensive. I'm currently looking for an alternative, such as hash function. I haven't found a good one yet (however), and i will probably write it by myself.</p>

</li><li><p> I'm also to optimise the execution times of <strong>Dos9_String.h</strong>. Those functions are allmost ubiquitus in the code, so that large parts of code will benefit from better execution rates. I'm especially targetting <strong>Dos9_SearchChar</strong> and <strong>Dos9_SearchToken</strong>, that account for a large share (about 10% time execution overall).</p>

</li></ul>
<p>All those test have be made for normal script optimisation, it was tested from a file that implement <strong>goto</strong>, <strong>if</strong>, <strong>set</strong> and <strong>echo command</strong>. I also performed some tests on <strong>for</strong> command, as expected, functions that are the most time consuming are not the same. Though, the functions i listed before were also much more time consuming than they need to be.</p>

</li><li><p> Improoved efficiency of <strong>Dos9_String.h</strong> and <strong>Dos9_Estr.c</strong> from the <strong>libDos9</strong> library. Also dissabled some piece of code that ran thread in some functions, that basically made them slow down. <strong>Dos9</strong> now achieve allmost equivalent performances in <strong>for</strong> loops (about 100 lines/s less than <strong>cmd.exe</strong>, without further optimisation), it also reach got execution rates at script level (with about 3250 lines/s while cmd.exe runs at 2720 lines/s on average). It is suprisingly good because I did not even finished optimisation yet, so much better performances can be expected.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug of <strong>IF</strong> command. The <strong>lss</strong> comparison operator was interpreted as <strong>leq</strong>.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 20th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Started comparisions between <strong>GCC</strong> optimisation levels.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug introduced in the function <strong>Dos9_SearchLastToken</strong>. It appears that, on windows, the code runs faster using <strong>-O2</strong> than using <strong>-O3</strong> optimisation switches, this might be caused by processor caching, but however, this should not be expected to have the same effect on variouss platform however. I ended up optimisation operations there, since the functions used by gprof account for about <strong>70%</strong> of the execution time, so that I'm not sure it is reliable now. With <strong>gprof</strong> version, i've be able to achieve speeds of about <strong>3700 l/s</strong>, so the result are expected to be at least double. In fact, by experimenting, I got only about <strong>4000 l/s</strong>, which it the speed of <strong>cmd</strong> on my computer when it consumes about 80%-90% of the cpu, in random occasion, because cmd.exe's has really random performances. Instead, <strong>Dos9</strong> is limited to approximately <strong>25%</strong>.</p>

<h2>Saturday 23th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Fixed a bug in <strong>Dos9_SearchLastChar</strong> function.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug with redirection that was not right delt with. <strong>Dos9</strong> did not check wether several block are in a row on the same line.</p>

</li><li><p> Added some functionnalities to the <strong>cmd/hlp.bat</strong> script, which is meant to replace old-fashioned <strong>hlp</strong> manual page viewer. It is bassically designed to act as a manual page manager rather than just a viewer, by providing interfaces to build manual trees, and to get manual tress from the repositories at <strong>dos9.org</strong> (this is to be implented later).</p>

</li><li><p> Changed names of the manual-pages subdirectories, they now match up with traditional *NIX-like local names that are widely used. Note that only usefull locales should be implemented (at most one for every language).</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Tuesday 25th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Implemented replacement for old <strong>ENABLE/DISABLEDOS9MODE</strong>. Instead of the variable, <strong>Dos9</strong> provides the <strong>CMDLYCORRECT</strong> options that can be set through <strong>SETLOCAL</strong>, and that enables more compatibility features for <strong>cmd.exe</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> Option <strong>CMDLYCORRECT</strong> now affects <strong>FOR</strong> loops: If the option is set, then all blank lines are to be stripped for the output.</p>

</li><li><p> Changed switch to specify part of lines that are not consituted of switches but by text. It is now <strong>//</strong>, a bit like *NIX's <strong>--</strong>.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 26th, March</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Added a short internal documentation to get help for internal functions. These are however much tinier that the full documentation given in <strong>HLP</strong>. This is voluntary, to fit in the executable.</p>

</li><li><p> First implementation of the <strong>CALL</strong> command is now working. This is somewhat blured because i've not written the full man page now, but it seems functionnal.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed bug in Makefiles.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a file from libDos9 that still used old name <strong>CALLSTACK</strong> instead of stack.</p>

</li><li><p> Found out that in some cases, <strong>tea</strong> breaks unicode sequences by intruding some line feed in the file, This remains to be fixed. This was actually fixed quickly.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that cause <strong>tea</strong> to loop infinitely if a word turned out to be to wide to fit on a single line. This is now fixed and long words are now splitted in multiple lines.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed numerous bugs introduced by use of various encoding in the documentation, that is, some file were not builded by <strong>hlp</strong> because iconv was not able to convert file from erroneous encoding. This has been fixed and all pages builds up well with <strong>hlp</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> Added a couple of manual pages. It is also combined with new pages and translations.</p>

</li></ul>
<h2>Wednesday 2nd, April</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Implemented aliases within Dos9</p>

</li><li><p> Added <strong>ALIAS</strong> command.</p>

</li><li><p> Improved robustness of <strong>Dos9_AddCommandDynamic</strong>.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed some bugs with <strong>CALL</strong> function that was not really functional. It works much better now, but the features have not been all tested yet.</p>

</li><li><p> Fixed a bug that caused <strong>%0</strong> not to be set to the correct value by the <strong>CALL</strong> command. Now, the behaviour is the following:</p>

<ul><li>
<p> if a <strong>label</strong> was given, <strong>%0</strong> contains this label.</p>

</li><li><p> if no <strong>label</strong> was given, <strong>%0</strong> contains the file name.</p>

</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2>Tuesday 3rd, April</h2>

<ul><li>
<p> Updated build system, so that building <strong>Dos9</strong> can allmost be done without user intervention. It's as simple as typing the following line:</p>

<code>make</code>

</li><li><p> Switched to version <strong>2014.0.9</strong>, because <strong>dos9</strong> is becoming pretty develloped now. </p>

</li></ul>
